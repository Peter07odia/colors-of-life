## 📱 Mobile Development Standards

### Development Rules (CRITICAL)
```typescript
// ✅ ALWAYS USE
- AsyncStorage (NEVER localStorage)

- TypeScript strict mode (NEVER any type)
- Zustand for state management
- Proper error handling with user feedback

// ❌ NEVER USE
- Web APIs (localStorage, sessionStorage, window, document)
- iOS Simulator for production testing
- Hardcoded values (use constants)
- Unhandled promise rejections
```
